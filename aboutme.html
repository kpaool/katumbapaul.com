        <p>I studied at Namilyango Junior Boys for primary school and then continued to Namilyango College for my high school. While at Namilyango College, I taught myself a lot of software development together with innovation to develop a number of projects with the biggest project being an artificial swamp that was helping villages in Namilyango to get clean water.

            This project won the National Water and Sewerage corporation innovation challenge as the best water protection project. Besides that, I worked on a number of other projects such as online voting, sports, and health tracking system.
