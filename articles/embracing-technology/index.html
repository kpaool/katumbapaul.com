	  	  	 	<p>Greetings,<br>
	  	  	 	 Technology is increasingly becoming part of our lives and we have to always be updated and learn how the new advancements that are being developed work. Unlike 20 years ago where real-time communication was expensive and not feasible, but today we connect with those we love and care about in a matter of seconds without having to physically meet. And this pandemic has only amplified the use of technology. I want you to know that this technology is here to make our lives better and more productive.</p>
<h5 class="h3 p-4" style="width: 50%;border-radius: 10px; background-color: #f2fdef;float: right; margin-left:10px "><i>Technology is here to help us save time, money and enjoy convenience</i></h5>
	  	  	<p>But for those who might not know what embracing technology means, I’ll break down real quick. Embracing technology is the use of computers and other intelligent digital devices to make life easy for humans for instance sending an email instead of postal mail services that take at least 2 days. We are living in the information era where data is more expensive to mine than gold. Meaning we have to always stay informed and make the proper decisions with the data we have. But that’s not all, the discovery of fire was a technological breakthrough. It meant man would live longer, have better feeding, and light up his house. Meaning technology is also using scientific procedures to make an already existing task even easier. So, man didn’t have to wait for the moon to get light at night, he simply had to make a fireplace and that was it.
	  	  	
	  	  	 	</p>
	  	  	 	
	  	<p> Today, so many technologies have been developed to suits our needs however broad they are and I will simply split them into three main categories and any other reasons might be subcategories of these.</p>
	  	<ol class="mb-3">
	  		<li>Technologies for convenience</li>
     		<li>Technologies to save time</li> 
		 <li>Technologies to save money
</li>
	  	</ol>
	  	  	 	<h3>Technologies for convenience</h3>
	  	  	 	<p>
	  	  	 		Under this category, the technologies developed here are to help people to get somethings automatically done for them without having to do the hard work. Under this category, anything that is repeatedly done by humans in made either easier or even the action is automated with less human supervision. Anything that humans find boring after doing it repeatedly can be made easier for people to do for instance shopping, downloading movies, managing a home, driving a car or even cooking. And for all these inconveniences, there are a number of technologies to fulfill our needs such as media streaming services, online shopping and delivery services, autonomous driving systems, food delivery technologies, smart homes, and cities, virtual and augmented reality technologies etc.  
	  	  	 	</p>
	  	  	 	<h5 class="h3 p-2" style="width: 50%;border-radius: 10px; background-color: #f2fdef;float: left; margin-right:20px "><i>We must be willing to learn new technologies and give feedback</i></h5>
	  	  	 	<p>
	  	  	 		As a founder of a company that is a convenience service, we ensure that at <a href="https://minute5.ug" class="text-white" style="text-decoration: underline">Minute5</a>  we deliver fresh food to consumers without them having to go through the trouble of going to a market, looking for parking, spending a lot of time there and then even risk getting sick more so in pandemic times like these. As a technology consumer, my demand is that I get boring repetitive inconvenient tasks of my hands so as to focus better and more productively on other tasks and this leads me to the next category,
	  	  	 		
	  	  	 	</p>
	 
	  	  	 
	  	  	 	<h3>Technologies to save time</h3>
	  	  	 	<p> Sometimes some tasks are achievable such as cooking or opening a bank account or even applying make-up or choosing clothes at a store but these take up a lot of time and therefore, there is a need for technologies that will help us get some of these tasks done in a shorter time such as e-banking, hire-out chef services or even other financial technology solutions, or even more interestingly, a technology that can help you try on over 100 dresses in just 5 minutes. </p>
	  	  	 	<p>
	  	  	 		These technologies might in the beginning, be looked at as luxurious solutions but 10-20 years from now will become essential. We need to be able to account for our time to ensure that we are more productive and get to create time that is going to probably give off a bigger return. And as I earlier introduce, in this information era, wasting time is equivalent to pouring millions and millions of money into a fire pit.
	  	  	 	</p>
	  	  	 	
	  	  	 	<h3>Technologies to save money</h3>
	  	  	 	<p>
	  	  	 		Anywhere in the world, we are always looking for ways to cut our expenditures and if we can’t we try to find a good high quality but affordable option so as to help us save money that might be used for future planning or for emergencies such as health emergencies. Having money stay on us is normal and we need to have plans to keep money on us all the times and so many technologies have been developed to help us save money such as online saving systems such as savings bank account or even digital SACCOs, discount stores, online registration systems, courier and delivery services, etc.
	  	  	 	</p>
	  	  	 	<p>
	  	  	 		All these solutions are designed in a way that they will encourage saving and later create even more value for them beyond saving money. And since money is a very big moving factor in the world, so many technologies have been developed in this field.
	  	  	 	</p>
	  	  	 	</br>
	  	  	 	<p>
	  	  	 		All in all, for us to gain from these technologies, we have to be truthful to ourselves and willing to learn how to use them because they help us become more productive. Also, we should be able to provide feedback on how best we can improve these technologies and more natural to use.
	  	  	 	</p>
